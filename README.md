# Project Multi-dimensional tree data structures

Main goal of the project is to index certain documents based on given keywords that can be given
manually or selected at random (See line 17 in main.py). After the trees are created, the method
LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) is used to check the similarities between documents. The 4 trees
implemented are:
    * K-D Tree
    * Quad Tree
    * Range Tree
    * R-

Details about the project can be found in the .pdf which is written in greek
